# Kanban Board Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Issues Not Showing on Kanban Board
**Problem**: Issues were not appearing in the Kanban board columns.

**Root Cause**: 
- Async `useMemo` in IssuesView was not working properly
- Data loading was not synchronizing correctly between components

**Solution**:
- Replaced async `useMemo` with `useEffect` for data loading
- Added proper state synchronization between parent and child components
- Added `useEffect` in KanbanBoard to sync localItems with props

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/IssuesView.tsx`
- `src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx`

### 2. Plus Button Not Working
**Problem**: The + button in Kanban column headers was not creating new issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- `createIssueWithProgress` function was calling `redirect()` which doesn't work in API routes
- Server actions can't be used directly in client components

**Solution**:
- Modified `createIssueWithProgress` to return `issueId` instead of redirecting
- Created separate function `createIssueWithProgressAndRedirect` for server components
- Changed KanbanColumn to use client-side fetch to API endpoint
- Fixed progress type mapping to use correct values

**Files Changed**:
- `src/actions/liveblocks.ts`
- `src/components/KanbanColumn.tsx`
- `src/app/api/create-issue/route.ts`

### 3. View Switcher Issues
**Problem**: View switcher between List and Board didn't always work properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- Data loading inconsistencies between views
- State synchronization issues

**Solution**:
- Simplified data loading in IssuesView
- Removed problematic async useMemo
- Added proper useEffect for data synchronization
- Improved error handling and state management

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/IssuesView.tsx`

### 4. Navigation Links
**Problem**: Clicking issues/projects from Kanban board should open correct detail pages.

**Root Cause**: Links were correctly implemented but needed verification.

**Solution**:
- Verified KanbanCard links use correct paths:
  - Issues: `/issue/${metadata.issueId}`
  - Projects: `/project/${metadata.issueId}`
- Added proper event handling to prevent conflicts with drag operations

**Files Verified**:
- `src/components/KanbanCard.tsx`

## Technical Improvements Made

### Data Flow Optimization
- Simplified async data handling
- Improved state synchronization
- Added optimistic UI updates for drag operations

### API Integration
- Fixed server action usage in client components
- Proper API endpoint for creating issues
- Improved error handling in API calls

### Type Safety
- Added proper TypeScript types for progress states
- Fixed type annotations for better IDE support
- Imported ProgressState type from config

### Performance
- Removed unnecessary async operations
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Added memoization where appropriate

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Issues**: Test + button in each column creates issues with correct progress
2. **Drag & Drop**: Verify dragging issues between columns updates progress
3. **View Switching**: Toggle between List and Board views multiple times
4. **Navigation**: Click on cards to ensure they open correct detail pages
5. **Data Persistence**: Refresh page to verify changes are saved

## Files Modified
